# DevDocs

## About

DevDocs is a Visual Studio Code extension designed to help developers quickly access technical documentation directly within their code editor. Tired of switching between your IDE and web browser to look up API documentation? With DevDocs, you can keep everything in one place and streamline your development workflow.

## Quick Start

1. Open the Command Palette by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS).
2. Type the following command:`Open Site: Author`
3. Press `Enter`. If everything is set up correctly, a page will open in VSCode.

### Supported Sites

Currently, DevDocs supports the following technologies:

- Vue
- React
- QianKun
- Node
- Tailwind CSS
- Next.js
- Nuxt.js
- Vuex
- Pinia
- Webpack
- TypeScript
- Deno
- W3C
- Styled Components
- Svelte

More sites will be added in future updates.

## Contribution

The world of technology is vast, and no single person can cover all the documentation available. We welcome contributions from the community to expand the content of this plugin. If you have suggestions or would like to add more documentation sites, please feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request.
