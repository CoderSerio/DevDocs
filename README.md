**DevDocs**
# About
Forgot some apis so needed open browser to search for documents about those？

Why not all in VSCode？
# Quickly Start
Press down `control`(`cmd` for Mac), `shift` and `p` at the same time, and then type in:
> open site: Author

If everything ok, you will open a page in VSCode.，

The supported is shown in below:
> Vue React QianKun Node <br> 
> Tailwindcss Next Nuxt Vuex <br> 
> Pinia Webpack TypeScript Deno <br>
> W3C StyledComponents Svelet 


More sites will be supported in future version.

# Expand
There is so much documentation out there that no one person can cover it all alone, so I hope everyone will come together to expand the content of this plugin. Welcome to fork:
