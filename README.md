**developer-sites-in-vscode**

# Basic Intro
hard to focus on coding because you forget some apis and need open browser to search for document about those？

Why not all in VSCode？

That's also my thoughts, so I try to make this VSCode extension plugin.

# How to use
press down `control`(`cmd` for Mac) `shift` and `p` at the same time, and then type in:

> open site:author-blog

if any thing ok, you will open a page in VSCode.

and sites like vue document and react document are supported too.

more sites will be supported in future version.

# About
I'm the author of this plugin, a student. It's my first time to make a plugin for VSCode that' s very interesting, as the same time, it means lots of bug is latent, but don't be worry, I'll solve those problems if you would like to tell me:
**https://github.com/CoderSerio/developer-sites-in-vscode/issues**

I have many coding plans, and I need collaborators.
code for fun, and my email:
